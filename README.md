### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm StÃ©phane, fullstack developper in the making, former safety engineer.
I like solving technical issues through my coding skills. 

## :mage: I'm currently trying to build stuff using
- Node.js
- Express
- PostgreSQL (sometimes with Sequelize as an ORM)
- GraphQL
- Sqitch
- Insomnia
- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML5/CSS3

## :alien: I am looking forward to learning more about
- Chai, Mocha (and TDD in general)
- MongoDB
- TypeScript
- Vue (or React. Or maybe Angular once I'm brave enough.)
- This list will keep growing.

## :inbox_tray: Wanna reach me?
